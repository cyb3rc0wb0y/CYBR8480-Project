# CYBR 8480 Project Milestone 2: Prototype development

## Overview
Project milestone 2 shows the progress we have made towards developing the app. We will go over the realization that our apps meets are user stories from the first milestone. We will then show some information on the app and what has been done to the application itself. We will also make sure the code has been properly documented so anyone can read it with ease. There will also be a few screen-shot that shows how the app is coming along. We will also show issues we have ran into.


## User Stories and Relization
As a **standard user**, I want to **view current temperature and condition** so I can **see what apparel is required for the day**.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
* App grabs user location
* App is able to interpret data to send off for correct data
* App displays the current temperature and conditions

*Relization add here

As a **standard user**, I want to **receive an email notification** so I can **view the weather forecast outside the application**.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
* App receives weather forecast from Weather API
* App is able to interpret data to determine the correct forecast
* App is able to send an email notification when the user selects the notification option

*Relization add here

As a **standard user**, I want to **view the phones current temperature** so I can **determine if the phone needs to be stored elsewhere**.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
* App receives data from phone's sensor
* App is able to interpret data to be displayed to screen
* App is able to correctly render the sensors data to the user

*Relization add here

### Submission materials
You should prepare a prototype application/product that demonstrates the three selected user stories. The prototype should include an IoT component and a mobile app. The app may be hybrid or native. The IoT component should use Bluetooth or another wireless protocol (such as RFID or Wi-Fi) to communicate. All code should be properly documented - with non-trivial code (such as methods and algorithms) briefly explained in-line using appropriate comments. Update your component descriptions associated with the architecture diagram with appropriate references in the code (where applicable). The last element of submission materials include a demo-ready compiled app that can demonstrate some basic functionality.

## Demo (Participation)
You must demo your app for Dr. Hale. You should show off the features you've realized so far, as well as speak to the current design problems you are encountering and how you will surmount them.

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prototype Demo* | The product is successfully demoed for Dr. Hale and the class. The individual/team addresses and handles questions well. | The demo partially works, but there are some significant issues. | Many significant issues or non-functional prototype.|
