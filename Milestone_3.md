## CYBR 8080 Project Milestone 3: Final MileStone

### Overview
This is the final milestone for the weather app that we have been working on this semester. It can grab data on where the phone is located and reach out to an API called OpenWeather API. Then it sends back the most up to date information for your phone's location. It also will notify the user by email if the phone gets too hot or too cold.

### Polish
Fixed errors that happened in milestone 2.

### Packaging and Release
Download the repository and load it into Android Studio and Android Studios will compile it. If errors happen it is most likely missing dependencies that need to be added. Android Studios will give you a prompt to install them. Once it is done you can load it onto a virtual device or grab the APK and move it to a physical phone.

#### Submission materials
The code can be grabbed from the github repository and compiled by anyone.

#### Hardware/Software Requirements


 * Create a ```hardware/software requirements``` section in your github repository and list the hardware components, software, and other technology required to make your app work.
 * Create ```installation``` and ```getting started``` instructions using markdown in your repository to detail what an end-user must do to setup and use your product.

#### Grading Criteria
